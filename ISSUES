Undecided timing:
-----------------

- if an MPI process fails (e.g., it seg faults), it causes orterun to
  hang.  This is with the rsh pls.
  --> Looks like the problem is with what happens when you set the
      state of the process in the soh to ORTE_PROC_STATE_ABORTED.
  --> Ralph is looking at this

- if the daemon is not found or fails to start, orterun will hang.  No
  indication is given to the users that something went wrong.
  --> Brian thinks he fixed this, but since he sets the state to
      ORTE_PROC_STATE_ABORTED, it won't be really clear until the
      above issue is fixed.  But it at least tells you what went
      wrong.

- $prefix/etc/hosts vs. $prefix/etc/openmpi-default-hostfile
  --> Brian temporarily added symlink in $prefix/etc/ for
      openmpi-default-hostfile -> hosts if there isn't already
      a hosts file so that he doesn't have to create one every
      time he does "rm -rf $prefix && make install".  Will file
      bug so that this can be fixed (and will fix in the trunk)


Pre-milestone:
--------------

- singleton mpi doesn't work

- Ralph: Populate orte_finalize()


Post-milestone:
---------------

- ras_base_alloc: doesn't allow for oversubscribing like this:

  eddie: cpu=2
  vogon: cpu=2 max-slots=4
  mpirun -np 6 uptime

  It barfs because it tries to evenly divide the remaining unallocated
  procs across all nodes (i.e., 1 each on eddie/vogon) rather than
  seeing that vogon can take the remaining 2.

- Jeff: TM needs to be re-written to use daemons (can't hog TM
  connection forever) 

- Jeff: make the mapper be able to handle app->map_data

- Jeff: add function callback in cmd_line_t stuff

- Jeff: does cmd_line_t need to *get* MCA params if a command line
  param is not taken but an MCA param is available?
  - consider empty string problem...

- ?: Friendlier error messages (e.g., if no nodes -- need something
  meaningful to tell the user)

- Ralph: compare and set function in GPR

- Jeff: collapse MCA params from 3 names to 1 name

- ?: Apply LANL copyright to trunk (post all merging activity)

- Probably during/after OMPI/ORTE split:
  - re-merge [orte|ompi]_pointer_array and [orte|ompi]_value_array
