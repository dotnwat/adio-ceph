  o Hierarchical striping as described in the paper from CCGrid2007
    http://ft.ornl.gov/projects/io/pubs/CCGrid-2007-file-joining.pdf
Further out:
  o To post the code for ParColl (Partitioned collective IO)
 
-----------------------------------------------------
V04: 
-----------------------------------------------------
  o Direct IO and Lockless IO support

-----------------------------------------------------
V03: 
-----------------------------------------------------
  o Correct detection of fs_type when lustre: prefix is not given
  o Further fix on stripe alignment
  o Tested/Enabled striping hints over Cray XT (Catamount and CNL)

-----------------------------------------------------
V02:
-----------------------------------------------------
The Lustre ADIO driver has been cleaned up quite a lot. Compared 
to the intital posting, here are the changes:
  o Removal of dead/redundant code
  o Removal of asynchronous IO piece as it appears outdated
  o Bug fixes for setting Lustre Hints
  o Bug fixes for data sieving 
  o Improved Setsize operation with one process calling ftruncate 
  o Improved collective IO with domain partitioning on 
    Lustre stripe boundary
