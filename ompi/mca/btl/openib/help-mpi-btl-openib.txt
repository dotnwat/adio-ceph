[no hca params found]
WARNING: No HCA parameters were found for the HCA that Open MPI
detected:

    Hostname:           %s
    HCA vendor ID:      0x%04x
    HCA vendor part ID: %d

Default HCA parameters will be used, which may result in lower
performance.  You can edit any of the files specified by the
btl_openib_hca_param_files MCA parameter to set values for your HCA.

NOTE: You can turn off this warning by setting the MCA parameter
      btl_openib_warn_no_hca_params_found to 0.
#
[init-fail-no-mem]
The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL failed to initialize while trying to
allocate some locked memory.  This typically can indicate that the
memlock limits are set too low.  For most HPC installations, the
memlock limits should be set to "unlimited".  The failure occured
here:

    Host:          %s
    OMPI source:   %s:%d
    Function:      %s()
    Device:        %s
    Memlock limit: %s

You may need to consult with your system administrator to get this
problem fixed.  This FAQ entry on the Open MPI web site may also be
helpful:

    http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ib-locked-pages
#
[init-fail-create-q]
The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL failed to initialize while trying to
create an internal queue.  This typically indicates a failed
OpenFabrics installation or faulty hardware.  The failure occured
here:

    Host:        %s
    OMPI source: %s:%d
    Function:    %s()
    Error:       %s (errno=%d)
    Device:      %s

You may need to consult with your system administrator to get this
problem fixed.
#
[btl_openib:retry-exceeded]
The InfiniBand retry count between two MPI processes has been
exceeded.  "Retry count" is defined in the InfiniBand spec 1.2
(section 12.7.38):

    The total number of times that the sender wishes the receiver to
    retry timeout, packet sequence, etc. errors before posting a
    completion error.

This error typically means that there is something awry within the
InfiniBand fabric itself.  You should note the hosts on which this
error has occurred; it has been observed that rebooting or removing a
particular host from the job can sometimes resolve this issue.  

Two MCA parameters can be used to control Open MPI's behavior with
respect to the retry count:

* btl_openib_ib_retry_count - The number of times the sender will
  attempt to retry (defaulted to 7, the maximum value).

* btl_openib_ib_timeout - The local ACK timeout parameter (defaulted
  to 10).  The actual timeout value used is calculated as:

     4.096 microseconds * (2^btl_openib_ib_timeout)

  See the InfiniBand spec 1.2 (section 12.7.34) for more details.

[no active ports found]
WARNING: There is at least on IB HCA found on host '%s', but there is
no active ports detected. This is most certainly not what you wanted.
Check your cables and SM configuration.
#
[error in hca init]
WARNING: There were errors during IB HCA initialization on host '%s'.
#
[default subnet prefix]
WARNING: There are more than one active ports on host '%s', but the
default subnet GID prefix was detected on more than one of these
ports.  If these ports are connected to different physical IB
networks, this configuration will fail in Open MPI.  This version of
Open MPI requires that every physically separate IB subnet that is
used between connected MPI processes must have different subnet ID
values.

Please see this FAQ entry for more details:

  http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ofa-default-subnet-gid

NOTE: You can turn off this warning by setting the MCA parameter
      btl_openib_warn_default_gid_prefix to 0.
#
[ibv_fork requested but not supported]
WARNING: fork() support was requested for the OpenFabrics (openib)
BTL, but it is not supported on the host %s.  Deactivating the
OpenFabrics BTL.
#
[ibv_fork_init fail]
WARNING: fork() support was requested for the OpenFabrics (openib)
BTL, but the library call ibv_fork_init() failed on the host %s.
Deactivating the OpenFabrics BTL.
#
[wrong buffer alignment]
Wrong buffer alignment %d configured on host '%s'. Should be bigger
than zero and power of two. Use default %d instead.
#
[of error event] 
The OpenFabrics stack has reported a network error event
Open MPI will try to continue, but your job may end up failing.

Host:              %s
MPI process PID:   %d
Error number:      %d
Error description: %s

This error may indicate connectivity problems within the fabric;
please contact your system administrator.
#
[of unknown event]
The OpenFabrics stack has reported an unknown network error event.
Open MPI will try to continue, but the job may end up failing.

Host:              %s
MPI process PID:   %d
Error number:      %d

This error may indicate that you are using an OpenFabrics library
version that is not currently supported by Open MPI.  You might try
recompiling Open MPI against your OpenFabrics library installation to
get more information.
#
[specified include and exclude]
ERROR: You have specified both the btl_openib_if_include and
btl_openib_if_exclude MCA parameters.  These two parameters are
mutually exclusive; you can only specify one or the other.  

For reference, the values that you specified are:

  btl_openib_if_include: %s
  btl_openib_if_exclude: %s
#
[nonexistent port]
WARNING: One or more nonexistent HCAs/ports were specified:

  Host:                 %s
  MCA parameter:        mca_btl_if_%sclude
  Nonexistent entities: %s

These entities will be ignored.  You can disable this warning by
setting the btl_openib_warn_nonexistent_if MCA parameter to 0.
#
[invalid mca param value]
WARNING: An invalid MCA parameter value was found for the OpenFabrics
(openib) BTL.

Problem:    %s
Resolution: %s
#
[no qps in receive_queues]
WARNING: No queue pairs were defined in the btl_openib_receive_queues
MCA parameter.  At least one queue pair must be defined.  The
OpenFabrics (openib) BTL will therefore be deactivated for this run.

Host: %s
#
[invalid qp type in receive_queues]
WARNING: An invalid queue pair type was specified in the
btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter.  The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL
will be deactivated for this run.

Valid queue pair types are "P" for per-peer and "S" for shared receive
queue.

Host: %s
btl_openib_receive_queues: %s
Bad specification: %s
#
[invalid pp qp specification]
WARNING: An invalid per-peer receive queue specification was detected
as part of the btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter.  The
OpenFabrics (openib) BTL will therefore be deactivated for this run.

Per-peer receive queues require between 1 and 5 parameters:

  1. Buffer size in bytes (mandatory)
  2. Number of buffers (optional; defaults to 8)
  3. Low buffer count watermark (optional; defaults to (num_buffers / 2))
  4. Credit window size (optional; defaults to (low_watermark / 2))
  5. Number of buffers reserved for credit messages (optional;
     defaults to (num_buffers*2-1)/credit_window)

  Example: P,128,256,128,16
  - 128 byte buffers
  - 256 buffers to receive incoming MPI messages
  - When the number of available buffers reaches 128, re-post 128 more
    buffers to reach a total of 256
  - If the number of available credits reaches 16, send an explicit
    credit message to the sender
  - Defaulting to ((256 * 2) - 1) / 16 = 31; this many buffers are
    reserved for explicit credit messages

Host: %s
Bad queue specification: %s
#
[invalid srq specification]
WARNING: An invalid shared receive queue specification was detected as
part of the btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter.  The OpenFabrics
(openib) BTL will therefore be deactivated for this run.

Shared receive queues can take between 2 and 4 parameters:

  1. Buffer size in bytes (mandatory)
  2. Number of buffers (optional; defaults to 16)
  3. Low buffer count watermark (optional; defaults to (num_buffers / 2))
  4. Maximum number of outstanding sends a sender can have (optional;
     defaults to (low_watermark / 4)

  Example: S,1024,256,128,32
  - 1024 byte buffers
  - 256 buffers to receive incoming MPI messages
  - When the number of available buffers reaches 128, re-post 128 more
    buffers to reach a total of 256
  - A sender will not send to a peer unless it has less than 32
    outstanding sends to that peer.

Host: %s
Bad queue specification: %s
#
[rd_num must be > rd_low]
WARNING: The number of buffers for a queue pair specified via the
btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter must be greater than the low
buffer count watermark.  The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL will therefore
be deactivated for this run.

Host: %s
Bad queue specification: %s
#
[biggest qp size is too small]
WARNING: The largest queue pair buffer size specified in the
btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter is smaller than the maximum
send size (i.e., the btl_openib_max_send_size MCA parameter), meaning
that no queue is large enough to receive the largest possible incoming
message fragment.  The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL will therefore be
deactivated for this run.

Host: %s
Largest buffer size: %d
Maximum send fragment size: %d
#
[biggest qp size is too big]
WARNING: The largest queue pair buffer size specified in the
btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter is larger than the maximum
send size (i.e., the btl_openib_max_send_size MCA parameter).  This
means that memory will be wasted because the largest possible incoming
message fragment will not fill a buffer allocated for incoming
fragments.

Host: %s
Largest buffer size: %d
Maximum send fragment size: %d
#
[freelist too small]

WARNING: The maximum freelist size that was specified was too small
for the requested receive queue sizes.  The maximum freelist size must
be at least equal to the sum of the largest number of buffers posted
to a single queue plus the corresponding number of reserved/credit
buffers for that queue.  It is suggested that the maximum be quite a
bit larger than this for performance reasons.

Host: %s
Specified freelist size: %d
Minimum required freelist size: %d
#
[XRC with PP or SRQ]
WARNING: An invalid queue pair type was specified in the
btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter.  The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL
will be deactivated for this run.

Note that XRC ("X") queue pairs cannot be used with per-peer ("P") and
SRQ ("S") queue pairs.  This restriction may be removed in future
versions of Open MPI.

Host: %s
btl_openib_receive_queues: %s
#
[XRC with BTLs per LID]
WARNING: An invalid queue pair type was specified in the
btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter.  The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL
will be deactivated for this run.

XRC ("X") queue pairs can not be used when (btls_per_lid > 1).  This
restriction may be removed in future versions of Open MPI.

[XRC on device without XRC support]
WARNING: You configured the OpenFabrics (openib) BTL to run with %d
XRC queues.  The device %s does not have XRC capabilities; the
OpenFabrics btl will ignore this device.  If no devices are found with
XRC capabilities, the OpenFabrics BTL will be disabled.

Host: %s
#
[No XRC support]
WARNING: The Open MPI build was compiled without XRC support, but XRC
("X") queues were specified in the btl_openib_receive_queues MCA
parameter.  The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL will therefore be deactivated
for this run.

Host: %s
btl_openib_receive_queues: %s
#
[XRC with OOB]
WARNING: You must use the "xoob" OpenFabrics (openib) connection
manager when XRC ("X") queues are specified in the
btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter.  Either remove the X queues
from btl_openib_receive_queues or ensure to use the "xoob" connection
manager by setting btl_openib_connect to "xoob".  The OpenFabrics BTL
will therefore be deactivated for this run.

Host: %s
num_xrc_qps: %d
#
[SRQ or PP with XOOB]
WARNINGS: You cannot specify to use per-peer ("P") or SRQ ("S") queues
in the btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter and also use the "xoob"
connection manager.  The "xoob" connection manager is for XRC ("X)
queues only; you must use one of the other connection managers for
per-peer/SRQ queues (such as "oob").
