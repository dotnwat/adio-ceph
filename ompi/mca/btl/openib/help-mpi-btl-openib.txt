[btl_openib:retry-exceeded]
The InfiniBand retry count between two MPI processes has been
exceeded.  "Retry count" is defined in the InfiniBand spec 1.2
(section 12.7.38):

    The total number of times that the sender wishes the receiver to
    retry timeout, packet sequence, etc. errors before posting a
    completion error.

This error typically means that there is something awry within the
InfiniBand fabric itself.  You should note the hosts on which this
error has occurred; it has been observed that rebooting or removing a
particular host from the job can sometimes resolve this issue.  

Two MCA parameters can be used to control Open MPI's behavior with
respect to the retry count:

* btl_openib_ib_retry_count - The number of times the sender will
  attempt to retry (defaulted to 7, the maximum value).

* btl_openib_ib_timeout - The local ACK timeout parameter (defaulted
  to 10).  The actual timeout value used is calculated as:

     4.096 microseconds * (2^btl_openib_ib_timeout)

  See the InfiniBand spec 1.2 (section 12.7.34) for more details.
[btl_openib:leave_pinned_multi_port]
# Until ticket #142 is fixed
This release of Open MPI does not support setting the
"mpi_leave_pinned" parameter to a true value when using multiple HCA
ports.  This warning is emitted when multiple HCA ports are detected
and "mpi_leave_pinned" is set to a true value, and is to inform you
that Open MPI is going to automatically disregard all HCA ports beyond
the first one (i.e., the MCA parameter "btl_openib_max_btls" parameter
has been overridden and set to 1).

You may silence this warning by setting the
"btl_openib_warn_leave_pinned_multi_port" MCA parameter to 0.
