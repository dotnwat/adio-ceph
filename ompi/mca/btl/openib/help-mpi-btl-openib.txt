[ini file:file not found]
The Open MPI OpenIB BTL component was unable to find or read an INI
file that was requested via the btl_openib_hca_param_files MCA
parameter.  Please check this file and/or modify the
btl_openib_hca_param_files MCA parameter:

    %s
[ini file:not in a section]
In parsing Open IB BTL parameter file, values were found that were not
in a valid INI section.  These values will be ignored.  Please
re-check this file:

    %s

At line %d, near the following text:

    %s
[ini file:unexpected token]
In parsing Open IB BTL parameter file, unexpected tokens were found
(this may cause significant portions of the INI file to be ignored).
Please re-check this file:

    %s

At line %d, near the following text:

    %s
[ini file:expected equals]
In parsing Open IB BTL parameter file, unexpected tokens were found
(this may cause significant portions of the INI file to be ignored).
An equals sign ("=") was expected but was not found.  Please re-check
this file:

    %s

At line %d, near the following text:

    %s
[ini file:expected newline]
In parsing Open IB BTL parameter file, unexpected tokens were found
(this may cause significant portions of the INI file to be ignored).
A newline was expected but was not found.  Please re-check this file:

[no hca params found]
WARNING: No HCA parameters were found for the HCA that Open MPI
detected:

    Hostname:           %s
    HCA vendor ID:      0x%04x
    HCA vendor part ID: %d

Default HCA parameters will be used, which may result in lower
performance.  You can edit any of the files specified by the
btl_openib_hca_param_files MCA parameter to set values for your HCA.

NOTE: You can turn off this warning by setting the MCA parameter
      btl_openib_warn_no_hca_params_found to 0.
[btl_openib:retry-exceeded]
The InfiniBand retry count between two MPI processes has been
exceeded.  "Retry count" is defined in the InfiniBand spec 1.2
(section 12.7.38):

    The total number of times that the sender wishes the receiver to
    retry timeout, packet sequence, etc. errors before posting a
    completion error.

This error typically means that there is something awry within the
InfiniBand fabric itself.  You should note the hosts on which this
error has occurred; it has been observed that rebooting or removing a
particular host from the job can sometimes resolve this issue.  

Two MCA parameters can be used to control Open MPI's behavior with
respect to the retry count:

* btl_openib_ib_retry_count - The number of times the sender will
  attempt to retry (defaulted to 7, the maximum value).

* btl_openib_ib_timeout - The local ACK timeout parameter (defaulted
  to 10).  The actual timeout value used is calculated as:

     4.096 microseconds * (2^btl_openib_ib_timeout)

  See the InfiniBand spec 1.2 (section 12.7.34) for more details.
[no active ports found]
WARNING: There is at least on IB HCA found on host '%s', but there is
no active ports detected. This is most certainly not what you wanted.
Check your cables and SM configuration.
[error in hca init]
WARNING: There were errors during IB HCA initialization on host '%s'.
