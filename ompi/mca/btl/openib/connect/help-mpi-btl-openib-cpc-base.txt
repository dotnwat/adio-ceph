[no cpcs for port]
No OpenFabrics connection schemes reported that they were able to be
used on a specific port.  As such, the openib BTL (OpenFabrics
support) will be disabled for this port.

[cpc name not found]
An invalid CPC name was specified via the btl_openib_cpc_%s MCA 
parameter.

  btl_openib_cpc_%s value: %s
  Invalid name:                 %s
  All possible valid names:     %s
#
[inline truncated]
WARNING: The btl_openib_ib_max_inline_data MCA parameter was used to
specify how much inline data should be used, but a device reduced this
value.  This is not an error; it simply means that your run will use
a smaller inline data value than was requested.

[bug #1693]
WARNING: ConnectX XRC support was enabled together with coalescing
mode.  This combination is not supported in this version of Open MPI
because it may cause random seg faults (please see Open MPI bug ticket
#1693 https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/1693 for more
details).  Message coalescing has been disabled in this job to prevent
catastrophic failure.

You can silence this warning either by disabling XRC (i.e., not specifying
an "X" queue in btl_openib_receive_queues) or disabling message
coalescing by setting the btl_openib_use_message_coalescing MCA
parameter to 0.
