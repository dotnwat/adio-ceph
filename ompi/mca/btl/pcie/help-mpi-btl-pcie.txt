[initialization:more-than-one-cpu]
The PCIe BTL found that the CPU affinity mask for the current process
includes more than one CPU (%d).  When using Open MPI on the Cell
machines with the PCIe driver, the affinity mask must include exactly
one CPU.
[initialization:no-cpus]
The PCIe BTL was unable to find any CPUs in the affinity mask for the
current process.  This usually indicates a system issue that must be
resolved by the system administrator.
