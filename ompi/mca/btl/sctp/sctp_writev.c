 * This implementation is based on the Socket API Extensions for SCTP
 * defined in <draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket-10.txt>

/* This library function assists the user with the advanced features
 * of SCTP.  This is a new SCTP API described in the section 8.7 of the
 * Sockets API Extensions for SCTP. This is implemented using the
 * sendmsg() interface.
 *
 * kmroz: Modification to this was trivial. const char* was replaced with const 
 * struct iovec* and the sendmsg call was replaced with a call to writev that 
 * takes *vector as a parameter.
