[all mem leaks]
The following memory locations were allocated via MPI_ALLOC_MEM but
not freed via MPI_FREE_MEM before invoking MPI_FINALIZE:

[some mem leaks]
The following memory locations were allocated via MPI_ALLOC_MEM but
not freed via MPI_FREE_MEM before invoking MPI_FINALIZE:

Process ID: %s
Hostname:   %s
PID:        %d

%s

%d additional leak%s recorded but %s not displayed here.  Set the MCA
parameter mpi_show_mpi_alloc_mem_leaks to a larger number to see that
many leaks, or set it to a negative number to see all leaks.
[leave pinned failed]
Process %s on host %s attempted to use the leave pinned
feature, but no memory registration hooks were found.  To solve this
problem, either link in the libopenmpi-malloc library or (on Linux)
do not set the MCA parameter base_disable_mallopt.
