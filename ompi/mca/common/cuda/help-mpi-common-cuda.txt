[cuCtxGetCurrent failed not initialized]
WARNING: The call to cuCtxGetCurrent() failed while attempting to register
internal memory with the CUDA environment.  The program will continue to run,
but the performance of GPU memory transfers may be reduced.  This failure
indicates that the CUDA environment is not yet initialized.  To eliminate
this warning, ensure that CUDA is initialized prior to calling MPI_Init.

NOTE: You can turn off this warning by setting the MCA parameter
      mpi_common_cuda_warning to 0.
