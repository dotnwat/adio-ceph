[sys call fail]
A system call failed during shared memory initialization that should
not have.  It is likely that your MPI job will now either abort or
experience performance degredation.

  Local host:  %s
  System call: %s %s
  Error:       %s (errno %d)
#
[mmap too small]
Open MPI requested a shared memory segment that was too small to do
anything useful.  This is likely an error in Open MPI itself.  If you
see this error, you should see if there is an update available for
Open MPI, and if not, contact the Open MPI developers.

  Local host:        %s
  Requested size:    %ul
  Control seg size:  %ul
  Data seg aligment: %ul
