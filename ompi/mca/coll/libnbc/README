* TODO:
- support MPI-2 collectives
- support MPI-2 Features (MPI_IN_PLACE)
- support MPI-2 Requests (really? -> I don't think so :)

* Missing for MPI-1:
- FORTRAN Bindings
- add user defined operations (coll9, coll10, coll11, longuser)
-- how do we ensure that we do not collide with Intrinsic Operations if
   we issue NBC_Ops???
-- we cannot issue NBC_Ops ... we need to issue MPI_Ops :-(. 
-- hmm, we could simply wrap it and save the user defined op in a
   list (hash) and search this every time we get called 
   --> cool idea, let's do that ...

* No Idea:
- what is wrong with nbcoll (does not work with Open MPI blocking colls)
