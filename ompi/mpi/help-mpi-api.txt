[spawn-from-singleton]
This version of Open MPI does not support %s from a 
"singleton" application.  Specifically, you cannot invoke an MPI
application like this:

    shell$ ./a.out

and then have a.out use the MPI-2 dynamic spawn functions.  Instead,
you must start your MPI application via mpirun:

    shell: mpirun -np 1 ./a.out
