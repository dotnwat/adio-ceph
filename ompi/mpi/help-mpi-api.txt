[mpi-function-after-finalize]
Calling any MPI-function after calling MPI_Finalize is erroneous.
The only exceptions are MPI_Initialized, MPI_Finalized and MPI_Get_version.

[mpi-initialize-twice]
Calling MPI_Init or MPI_Init_thread twice is erroneous.

[spawn-from-singleton]
This version of Open MPI does not support %s from a 
"singleton" application.  Specifically, you cannot invoke an MPI
application like this:

    shell$ ./a.out

and then have a.out use the MPI-2 dynamic spawn functions.  Instead,
you must start your MPI application via mpirun:

    shell: mpirun -np 1 ./a.out
