[mpi_init:startup:internal-failure]
It looks like %s failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can

  %s
  --> Returned value %d instead of OMPI_SUCCESS
[mpi-param-check-enabled-but-compiled-out]
WARNING: The MCA parameter mpi_param_check has been set to true, but
parameter checking has been compiled out of Open MPI.  The
mpi_param_check value has therefore been ignored.
