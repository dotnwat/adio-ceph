# Sample configuration file for the test_build.pl script.
#
# First argument: String name of the configuration, used for
# describing and labeling the result.  Names should not be repeated in
# one configuration file (no error checking is performed; if multiple
# lines have the same name, the results of only one of them will be
# reported). 
#
# Second argument: Whether to combine stdout and stderr (1), or leave
# them separate (blank).  You should probably only use (1) for when
# you want to see the warnings from "make all", and leave it blank for
# all other cases.
#
# Third argument: VPATH mode.  Must be the strings "absolute",
# "relative", or blank.  If "absolute", then the configure script will
# be run as an absolute VPATH (i.e., top_builddir != top_srcdir, and
# configure's absolute path will be used for invocation).  If
# "relative", the setup as the same except that a relative path to
# configure is used.  If blank (or any other value), a non-VPATH build
# is used.
#
# Fourth argument: arbitrary strings to pass to configure.  You can
# set environment flags here, specific options to configure, etc.  You
# should *not* specify a --prefix argument; that is the only argument
# supplied by the testing script.
#
# Examples:
#
# warnings:1::--enable-picky
# default build:::
# absolute vpath:::absolute:CFLAGS=-g
# static build:::--disable-shared --enable-static
#
warnings:1::--enable-picky
default build:::
static build:::--disable-shared --enable-static
non-threaded build:::--without-threads
