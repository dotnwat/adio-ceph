/*
 * Pack one or more values into a buffer
 * The pack function packs one or more values of a specified type into the specified buffer.
 * The buffer must have already been initialized via an OBJ_NEW call - 
 * otherwise, the pack_value function will return an error. Providing an
 * unsupported type flag will likewise be reported as an error.
 * 
 * Note that any data to be packed that is not hard type cast (i.e., not type cast
 * to a specific size) may lose precision when unpacked by a non-homogeneous recipient.
 * The DPS will do its best to
 * deal with heterogeneity issues between the packer and unpacker in such cases. Sending
 * a number larger than can be handled by the recipient will return an error code (generated
 * by the DPS upon unpacking) via the RML upon transmission - the DPS cannot detect
 * such errors during packing.
 * 
 * @param *buffer A pointer to the buffer into which the value is to be packed.
 * @param *src A void* pointer to the data that is to be packed. Note that strings are
 * to be passed as (char **) - i.e., the caller must pass the address of the pointer
 * to the string as the void*. This allows the DPS to use a single interface function,
 * but still allow the caller to pass multiple strings in a single call.
 * @param num A size_t value indicating the number of values that are to be
 * packed, beginning at the location pointed to by src. A string value is counted as a
 * single value regardless of length. The values must be contiguous in memory. Arrays of
 * pointers (e.g., string arrays) should be contiguous, although (obviously) the data
 * pointed to need not be contiguous across array entries.
 * @param type The type of the data to be packed - must be one of the DPS defined
 * data types.
 * 
 * @retval ORTE_SUCCESS The data was packed as requested.
 * @retval ORTE_ERROR(s) An appropriate ORTE error code indicating the problem
 * encountered. This error code should be handled appropriately.

/* Unpack one or more values from a buffer
 * The unpack function unpacks one or more values of a specified type from the
 * specified buffer.
 * The buffer must have already been initialized via an OBJ_NEW call - 
 * otherwise, the unpack_value function will return an error. Providing an
 * unsupported type flag will likewise be reported as an error, as will specifying a
 * data type that DOES NOT match the type of the next item in the buffer. An attempt
 * to read beyond the end of the stored data held in the buffer will also return
 * an error.
 * 
 * Unpacking values is a "destructive" process - i.e., the values are removed from
 * the buffer, thus reducing the buffer size. It is therefore not possible for the
 * caller to re-unpack a value from the same buffer.
 * 
 * Warning: The caller is responsible for providing adequate memory storage for
 * the requested data. The DPS peek_next_item function is provided to assist in
 * meeting this requirement. The user can provide a max_num_values argument to ensure
 * that memory overruns are prevented. If more values are present in the buffer, the
 * unpack function will unpack as much as it can - and then return an error
 * ORTE_UNPACK_READ_PAST_END_OF_BUFFER.
 * 
 * Note that any data that was not hard type cast (i.e., not type cast
 * to a specific size) when packed may lose precision when unpacked by a non-homogeneous recipient.
 * The DPS will do its best to
 * deal with heterogeneity issues between the packer and unpacker in such cases. Sending
 * a number larger than can be handled by the recipient will return an error code  (generated
 * by the DPS upon unpacking) via the RML upon transmission - the DPS cannot detect
 * such errors during packing.
 * 
 * @param *buffer A pointer to the buffer from which the value will be extracted.
 * @param *dest A void* pointer to the memory location into which the data is to be
 * stored. Note that these values will be stored contiguously in memory. For strings,
 * this pointer must be to (char **) to provide a means of supporting multiple string
 * operations. The DPS unpack function will allocate memory for each string in the array -
 * the caller must only provide adequate memory for the array of pointers.
 * @param *num A pointer to a size_t value indicating the maximum number of values that are to be
 * unpacked, beginning at the location pointed to by src. This is provided to help
 * protect the caller from memory overrun - providing a value of "0" tells the DPS
 * to unpack ALL of the values stored in this item. This should be used with caution
 * as the caller must then be absolutely certain that adequate memory has been allocated
 * for this operation. Note that a string value is counted as a single value regardless
 * of length.
 * 
 * @note The unpack function will return the actual number of values unpacked in
 * this location.
 * 
 * @param type The type of the data to be unpacked - must be one of the DPS defined
 * data types.
 * 
 * @retval *num The number of values actually unpacked. In most cases,
 * this should match the maximum number provided in the parameters - but in no case
 * will it exceed that parameter.
 * 
 * @retval ORTE_SUCCESS The next item in the buffer was successfully unpacked.
 * 
 * @retval ORTE_ERROR(s) The unpack function returns an error code under one of several
 * conditions: (a) the number of values in the item exceeds the max num provided by the
 * caller; (b) the type of the next item in the buffer does not match the type specified
 * by the caller; or (c) the unpack failed due to either an error in the buffer or
 * an attempt to read past the end of the buffer.
