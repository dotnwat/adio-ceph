Usage: %s --local-offset <vpid> --global_start_vpid <vpid> 
          --num_procs <num> [--high-qos]

  --local_offset <vpid>	      Starting vpid from which to assign for all
                              processes started by this bootproxy
  --global_start_vpid <vpid>  Starting vpid for the call to
                              spawn_procs that resulted in this
                              bootproxy being launched.
  --num_procs <num>           Total number of processes started in the
                              call to spawn_procs that resulted in
                              this bootproxy being launched
  --high-qos                  Do not exit until all processes started
                              have exited.  Do not close
                              std{in,out,err}.  If one process exits
                              with non-zero status, kill the remaining
                              started processes.
[could-not-receive-schedule]
Open MPI was unable to start a process on one or more nodes using the
bootproxy strartup mechanism.  The bootproxy client was able to
start but was not able to receive the scheduling information from the
starting process.  The error returned was %d.
[could-not-chdir]
Open MPI was unable to start a process on one or more nodes using the
bootproxy strartup mechanism.  The bootproxy client was able to
start and receive startup information, but was unable to set the
current working directory of the new process.

  Current working directory was: %s
  The error from chdir was:      %s
[could-not-fork]
Open MPI was unable to start a process on one or more nodes using the
bootproxy strartup mechanism.  The bootproxy client was able to
start and receive startup information, but was unable to fork the new
process.

  I was trying to start:         %s
  The error from fork was:       %s
[could-not-exec]
Open MPI was unable to start a process on one or more nodes using the
bootproxy strartup mechanism.  The bootproxy client was able to
start and receive startup information, but was unable to exec the new
process.

  I was trying to start:         %s
  Current working directory was: %s
  The error from exec was:       %s
