[mpirun:init-failure]
Open MPI was unable to initialize properly.  The error occured while
attempting to %s.  Returned value %d instead of OMPI_SUCCESS.
[mpirun:usage]
Usage: %s [OPTION]...  [PROGRAM]...
Start the given program using Open MPI

%s
[mpirun:allocate-resources]
%s was unable to allocate enough resources to start your application.
This might be a transient error (too many nodes in the cluster were
unavailable at the time of the request) or a permenant error (you
requsted more nodes than exist in your cluster).

While probably only useful to Open MPI developers, the error returned
was %d.
[mpirun:no-application]
%s was unable to find an application to start.  This may mean you
forgot to specify the application to start on the commend line.  Or it
could mean that you have an error with another option on the command
line and confused the command line parser.  "%s --help" will provide a
detailed usage guide.
[mpirun:error-spawning]
%s was unable to start the specified application.  An attempt has been
made to clean up all processes that did start.  The error returned was
%d.
[mpirun:proc-reg-failed]
All proccess started by %s failed to reach MPI_Init().  This is a
fatal error, and not much information is available at this time as to
why the processes didn't start.  It is possible that an error message
describing the problem has already been printed above.
