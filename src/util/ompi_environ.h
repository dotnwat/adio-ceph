     * saved in \em env)
     * @retval OMPI_SUCESS If the value replaced another value or is
     * appended to \em env.

     * \em env is expected to be a NULL-terminated array of pointers
     * (argv-style).  Note that unlike some implementations of
     * putenv(3), if \em value is insertted in \em env, it is copied.
     * So the caller can modify/free both \em name and \em value after
     * ompi_setenv() returns.
     *
     * The \em env array will be grown if necessary.

     * It is permissable to invoke this function with the

     *   extern char **environ;
     *   ompi_setenv("foo", "bar", true, &environ);
     * \endcode
     *
     * NOTE: If you use the real environ, ompi_setenv() will turn
     * around and perform putenv() to put the value in the
     * environment.  This may very well lead to a memory leak, so its
     * use is strongly discouraged.
     *
     * It is also permissable to call this function with an empty \em
     * env, as long as it is pre-initialized with NULL:
     *
     * \code
     *   char **my_env = NULL;
     *   ompi_setenv("foo", "bar", true, &my_env);
     * \endcode
