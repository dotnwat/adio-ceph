# This is the VERSION file for Open MPI, describing the precise
# version of Open MPI in this distribution.  The various components of
# the version number below are combined to form a single version
# number string.

# major, minor, and release are generally combined in the form
# <major>.<minor>.<release>.  If minor and release are both zero, then
# release is omitted.

major=4
minor=5
release=6

# Only one of alpha or beta can be nonzero.  If both are zero, alpha
# will be preferred.  If alpha is nonzero, it will be appended to the
# version string as "a<alpha>".  If beta is nonzero (and alpha is
# zero), it will be appended to the version string as "b<beta>".

alpha=0
beta=0

# If want_svn=1, then the SVN r number will be included in the overall
# Open MPI version number in some form.

want_svn=1

# If svn_r=-1, then the SVN r numbere will be obtained dynamically at
# run time, either 1) via the "svnversion" command (if this is a
# Subversion checkout) in the form "r<svn_r>", or b) with the date (if
# this is not a Subversion checkout, and the svnversion command cannot
# be used) in the form of "svn<date>".  Alternatively, if svn_r is not
# -1, the value of svn_r will be directly appended to the version
# string.  This happens during "make dist", for example: if the
# distribution tarball is being made from an SVN checkout, the value
# of svn_r in this file is replaced with the output of "svnversion".

svn_r=-1
