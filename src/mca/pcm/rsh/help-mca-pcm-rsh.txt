It is likely that there is some output above this error message that
will give more information than appears here.  The best information
available is that the error was %s.
[spawn:stderr-output]
Open MPI was unable to start a process on one or more nodes using the
rsh startup mechanism.  Output was received on stderr of the startup
command (%s).  This is usually a sign that an error has occurred.
The full command executed was:

  %s
[spawn:no-process-record]
Open MPI was notified that process %d exited with status %d.
Unfortunately, that process could not be found in our internal
tables.  This most likely means that an error in the RSH PCM of Open
MPI has occurred.  Please let the developers know how you came across 
this message so that it can be fixed.
[spawn:application-send]
Open MPI was unable to start a process on one or more nodes using the
