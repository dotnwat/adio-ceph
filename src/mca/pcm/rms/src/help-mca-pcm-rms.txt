[spawn:multiple-apps]
Open MPI was unable to start a process on one or more nodes using the
rms startup mechanism.  The failure is because the Open MPI rms
process starter is not capable of starting jobs involving multiple
executables.
[spawn:multiple-nodelists]
Open MPI was unable to start a process on one or more nodes using the
rms startup mechanism.  The failure is because the Open MPI rms
process starter is not capable of starting jobs involving node
assignments.
[spawn:fork]
Open MPI was unable to start a process on one or more nodes using the
rms startup mechanism.  The failure occurred when the process starter
attempted to call the fork system call.  The resulting error was:

  %s
[spawn:chdir]
Open MPI was unable to start a process on one or more nodes using the
rms startup mechanism.  The failure occurred when the process starter
attempted to change the current working directory to:

  %s

The error from the chdir call was:

  %s
[spawn:exec-prun]
Open MPI was unable to start a process on one or more nodes using the
rms startup mechanism.  The failure occrred when trying to start %s.
The error from exec was %s.
[spawn:no-process-record]
Open MPI was notified that process %d exited with status %d.
Unfortunately, that process could not be found in our internal
tables.  This most likely means that an error in the rsh pcm of Open
MPI has occurred.  Please let the developers know how you came across 
this message so that it can be fixed.
