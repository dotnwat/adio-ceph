[stacktrace signal override]
Open MPI was inserting a signal handler for signal %d but noticed
that there is already a non-default handler installed.  Open MPI's
handler was therefore not installed; your job will continue.  This
warning message will only be displayed once, even if Open MPI
encounters this situation again.

To avoid displaying this warning message, you can either not install
the error handler for signal %d or you can have Open MPI not try to
install its own signal handler for this signal by setting the
"opal_signals" MCA parameter.

  Signal: %d
  Current opal_signal value: %s
