[invalid policy]
WARNING: An invalid value was given for the
hwloc_base_general_alloc_policy MCA parameter.  This MCA parameter
determines the policy used for general memory allocations.  Note that
this parameter *only* has effect when MPI processes are bound to
specific processors.

The value provided was:

  Local host: %s
  PID:        %d
  Value:      %s

Valid values are:

  none:         no memory binding policy is enforced
  local_only:   fail an allocation if it cannot be placed entirely on
                the local NUMA node

Your job will now abort.
#
[mbind failure]
Open MPI failed to bind internal memory to a specific NUMA node.  This
message will only be reported at most once per process.

  Local host: %s
  PID:        %d
  File:       %s:%d
  Message:    %s
  Severity:   %s
#
[unrecognized-policy]
The specified %s policy is not recognized:

  Policy: %s

Please check for a typo or ensure that the option is a supported
one.
#
[logical-cpu-not-found]
A specified logical processor does not exist in this topology:

  Cpu set given:  %s
#
[redefining-policy]
Conflicting directives for binding policy are causing the policy
to be redefined:

  New policy:   %s
  Prior policy:  %s

Please check that only one policy is defined.
