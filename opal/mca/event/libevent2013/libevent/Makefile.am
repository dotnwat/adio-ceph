# This is the "Release" of the Libevent ABI.  It takes precedence over

# This is the version info for the libevent binary API.  It has three
# numbers:
#   Current  -- the number of the binary API that we're implementing
#   Revision -- which iteration of the implementation of the binary
#               API are we supplying?
#   Age      -- How many previous binary API versions do we also
#               support?
#
# To increment a VERSION_INFO (current:revision:age):
#    If the ABI didn't change:
#        Return (current:revision+1:age)
#    If the ABI changed, but it's backward-compatible:
#        Return (current+1:0:age+1)
#    If the ABI changed and it isn't backward-compatible:
#        Return (current+1:0:0)

# UNLESS YOU REALLY REALLY HAVE TO.

# ABI version history for this package effectively restarts every time
# we change RELEASE.  Version 1.4.x had RELEASE of 1.4.
#
# Ideally, we would not be using RELEASE at all; instead we could just
# use the VERSION_INFO field to label our backward-incompatible ABI
# changes, and those would be few and far between.  Unfortunately,
# Libevent still exposes far too many volatile structures in its
# headers, so we pretty much have to assume that most development
# series will break ABI compatibility.  For now, it's simplest just to
# keep incrementing the RELEASE between series and resetting VERSION_INFO.
#
# Eventually, when we get to the point where the structures in the
# headers are all non-changing (or not there at all!), we can shift to
# a more normal worldview where backward-incompatible ABI changes are
# nice and rare.  For the next couple of years, though, 'struct event'
# is user-visible, and so we can pretty much guarantee that release
# series won't be binary-compatible.
