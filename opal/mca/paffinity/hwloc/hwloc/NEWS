This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of hwloc since version
0.9 (as initially released as "libtopology", then re-branded to "hwloc"
in v0.9.1).

Version 1.0.0
-------------

* The ABI of the library has changed.
* Backend updates
  + Add FreeBSD support.
  + Add x86 cpuid based backend.
  + Add Linux cgroup support to the Linux cpuset code.
  + Support binding of entire multithreaded process on Linux.
  + Cleanup XML export/import.
* Objects
  + HWLOC_OBJ_PROC is renamed into HWLOC_OBJ_PU for "Processing Unit",
    its stringified type name is now "PU".
  + Use new HWLOC_OBJ_GROUP objects instead of MISC when grouping
    objects according to NUMA distances or arbitrary OS aggregation.
  + Rework memory attributes.
  + Add different cpusets in each object to specify processors that
    are offline, unavailable, ...
  + Cleanup the storage of object names and DMI infos.
* Features
  + Add support for looking up specific PID topology information.
  + Add hwloc_topology_export_xml() to export the topology in a XML file.
  + Add hwloc_topology_get_support() to retrieve the supported features
    for the current topology context.
  + Support non-SYSTEM object as the root of the tree, use MACHINE in
    most common cases.
  + Add hwloc_get_*cpubind() routines to retrieve the current binding
    of processes and threads.
* API
  + Add HWLOC_API_VERSION to help detect the currently used API version.
  + Add missing ending "e" to *compare* functions.
  + Add several routines to emulate PLPA functions.
  + Rename and rework the cpuset and/or/xor/not/clear operators to output
    their result in a dedicated argument instead of modifying one input.
  + Deprecate hwloc_obj_snprintf() in favor of hwloc_obj_type/attr_snprintf().
  + Clarify the use of parent and ancestor in the API, do not use father.
  + Replace hwloc_get_system_obj() with hwloc_get_root_obj().
  + Return -1 instead of HWLOC_OBJ_TYPE_MAX in the API since the latter
    isn't public.
  + Relax constraints in hwloc_obj_type_of_string().
  + Improve displaying of memory sizes.
  + Add 0x prefix to cpuset strings.
* Tools
  + lstopo now displays logical indexes by default, use --physical to
    revert back to OS/physical indexes.
  + Add colors in the lstopo graphical outputs to distinguish between online,
    offline, reserved, ... objects.
  + Extend lstopo to show cpusets, filter objects by type, ...
  + Renamed hwloc-mask into hwloc-calc which supports many new options.
* Documentation
  + Add a hwloc(7) manpage containing general information.
  + Add documentation about how to switch from PLPA to hwloc.
  + Cleanup the distributed documentation files.
* Miscellaneous
  + Many compilers warning fixes.
  + Cleanup the ABI by using the visibility attribute.
  + Add project embedding support.


Version 0.9.4 (unreleased)
--------------------------

* Fix reseting colors to normal in lstopo -.txt output.
* Fix Linux pthread_t binding error report.


Version 0.9.3
-------------

* Fix autogen.sh to work with Autoconf 2.63.
* Fix various crashes in particular conditions:
  - xml files with root attributes
  - offline CPUs
  - partial sysfs support
  - unparseable /proc/cpuinfo
  - ignoring NUMA level while Misc level have been generated
* Tweak documentation a bit
* Do not require the pthread library for binding the current thread on Linux
* Do not erroneously consider the sched_setaffinity prototype is the old version
  when there is actually none.
* Fix _syscall3 compilation on archs for which we do not have the
  sched_setaffinity system call number.
* Fix AIX binding.
* Fix libraries dependencies: now only lstopo depends on libtermcap, fix
  binutils-gold link
* Have make check always build and run hwloc-hello.c
* Do not limit size of a cpuset.


Version 0.9.2
-------------

* Trivial documentation changes.


Version 0.9.1
-------------

* Re-branded to "hwloc" and moved to the Open MPI project, relicensed under the
  BSD license.
* The prefix of all functions and tools is now hwloc, and some public
  functions were also renamed for real.
* Group NUMA nodes into Misc objects according to their physical distance
  that may be reported by the OS/BIOS.
  May be ignored by setting HWLOC_IGNORE_DISTANCES=1 in the environment.
* Ignore offline CPUs on Solaris.
* Improved binding support on AIX.
* Add HP-UX support.
* CPU sets are now allocated/freed dynamically.
* Add command line options to tune the lstopo graphic output, add
  semi-graphical text output
* Extend topobind to support multiple cpusets or objects on the command
  line as topomask does.
* Add an Infiniband-specific helper hwloc/openfabrics-verbs.h to retrieve
  the physical location of IB devices.


Version 0.9 (libtopology)
-------------------------

* First release.
