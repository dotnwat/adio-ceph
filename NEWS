===========================================================================

This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of Open MPI since
version 1.0.

1.1
---

- Updated ROMIO with the version from MPICH 1.2.7p1, marked as version
  2005-06-09.
- Add --debug option to mpirun to generically invoke a parallel debugger.


1.0.1
-----

- Fixed long messages in the send-to-self case.
- Ensure that when the "leave_pinned" option is used, the memory hooks
  are also enabled.  Thanks to Gleb Natapov for pointing this out.
- Fixed compile errors for IRIX.
- Allow hostfiles to have integer host names (for BProc clusters)
- Fixed a problem with message matching of out-of-order fragments in
  multiple network device scenarios.
- Converted all the C++ MPI bindings to use proper const_cast<>'s
  instead of old C-style casts to get rid of const-ness.  Thanks to
  Martin Audet for raising the issue with us.
- Converted MPI_Offset to be a typedef instead of a #define because it
  causes problems for some C++ parsers.  Thanks to Martin Audet for
  bringing this to our attention.
- Improved latency of TCP BTL.
- Fixed index value in MPI_TESTANY to be MPI_UNDEFINED if some
  requests were not MPI_REQUEST_NULL, but no requests finished.
- Fixed several Fortran MPI API implementations that incorrectly used
  integers instead of logicals or address-sized integers.
- Fix so that Open MPI correctly handles the Fortran value for .TRUE.,
  regardless of what the Fortran compiler's value for .TRUE. is.
- Improved scalability of MX startup.
- Fix datatype offset handling in the coll basic component's
  MPI_SCATTERV implementation.
- Fix EOF handling on stdin.
- Fix missing MPI_F_STATUS_IGNORE and MPI_F_STATUSES_IGNORE
  instanatiations.  Thanks to Anthony Chan for pointing this out.
- Add a missing value for MPI_WIN_NULL in mpif.h.
- Bring over some fixes for the sm btl that somehow didn't make it
  over from the trunk before v1.0.  Thanks to Beth Tibbitts and Bill
  Chung for helping identify this issue.
- Bring over some fixes for the iof that somehow didn't make it over
  from the trunk before v1.0.
- Fix for --with-wrapper-ldflags handling.  Thanks to Dries Kimpe for
  pointing this out to us.
