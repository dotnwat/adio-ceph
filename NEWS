===========================================================================

This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of Open MPI since
version 1.0.

1.1
---

- Open MPI is now configurable in cross-compilation environments.
  Several Fortran 77 and Fortran 90 tests need to be pre-seeded with
  results from a config.cache-like file.
- Add --debug option to mpirun to generically invoke a parallel debugger.


1.0.2
-----

- Change the behavior of orterun (mpirun, mpirexec) to search for
  argv[0] and the cwd on the target node (i.e., the node where the
  executable will be running in all systems except BProc, where the
  searches are run on the node where orterun is invoked).
- Fix race condition in shared memory transport that could cause
  crashes on machines with weak memory consistency models (including
  POWER/PowerPC machines).
- Fix warnings about setting read-only MCA parameters on bproc systems.
- Change the exit status set by mpirun when an application process is
  killed by a signal.  The exit status is now set to signo + 128, which
  conforms with the behavior of (almost) all shells.
- Correct a datatype problem with the convertor when partially
  unpacking data. Now we can position the convertor to any position
  not only on the predefined types boundaries. Thanks to Yvan Fournier
  for reporting this to us.
- Fix a number of standard I/O forwarding issues, including the
  ability to background mpirun and a loss of data issue when
  redirecting mpirun's standard input from a file.
- Fixed bug in ompi_info where rcache and bml MCA parameters would not
  be displayed.
- Fixed umask issues in the session directory.  Thanks to Glenn Morris
  for reporting this to us.
- Fixed tcsh-based LD_LIBRARY_PATH issues with --prefix.  Thanks to
  Glen Morris for identifying the problem and suggesting the fix.
- Removed extraneous \n's when setting PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the
  rsh startup.  Thanks to Glen Morris for finding these typos.
- Fixed missing constants in MPI C++ bindings.
- Fixed some errors caused by threading issues.
- Fixed openib BTL flow control logic to not overrun the number of
  send wqes available.
- Update to match newest OpenIB user-level library API.  Thanks to
  Roland Dreier for submitting this patch.
- Report errors properly when failing to register memory in the openib
  BTL.
- Reduce memory footprint of openib BTL.
- Fix parsing problem with mpirun's "-tv" switch.  Thanks to Chris
  Gottbrath for supplying the fix.
- Fix Darwin net/if.h configure warning.
- The GNU assembler unbelievably defaults to making stacks executable.
  So when using gas, add flags to explicitly tell it to not make
  stacks executable (lame but necessary).
- Add missing MPI::Request::Get_status() methods.  Thanks to Bill
  Saphir for pointing this out to us.
- Improved error messages on memory registration errors (e.g., when
  using high-speed networks).
- Open IB support now checks firmware for how many outstanding RDMA
  requests are supported.  Thanks to Mellanox for pointing this out to
  us.
- Enable printing of stack traces in MPI processes upon SIGBUS,
  SIGSEGV, and SIGFPE if the platform supports it.
- Fixed F90 compilation support for the Lahey compiler.
- Fixed issues with ROMIO shared library support.
- Fixed internal accounting problems with rsh support.
- Update to GNU Libtool 1.5.22.
- Fix error in configure script when setting CCAS to ias (the Intel
  assembler)
- Added missing MPI::Intercomm collectives.
- Fixed MPI_IN_PLACE handling for Fortran collectives.
- Fixed some more C++ const_cast<> issues.  Thanks for Martin Audet
  (again) for bringing this to our attention.
- Updated ROMIO with the version from MPICH 1.2.7p1, marked as version
  2005-06-09.
- Fixes for some cases where the use of MPI_BOTTOM could cause
  problems.
- Properly handle the case where an mVAPI does not have shared receive
  queue support (such as the one shipped by SilverStorm / Infinicon
  for OS X).


1.0.1
-----

- Fixed assembly on Solaris AMD platforms.  Thanks to Pierre Valiron
  for bringing this to our attention.
- Fixed long messages in the send-to-self case.
- Ensure that when the "leave_pinned" option is used, the memory hooks
  are also enabled.  Thanks to Gleb Natapov for pointing this out.
- Fixed compile errors for IRIX.
- Allow hostfiles to have integer host names (for BProc clusters).
- Fixed a problem with message matching of out-of-order fragments in
  multiple network device scenarios.
- Converted all the C++ MPI bindings to use proper const_cast<>'s
  instead of old C-style casts to get rid of const-ness.  Thanks to
  Martin Audet for raising the issue with us.
- Converted MPI_Offset to be a typedef instead of a #define because it
  causes problems for some C++ parsers.  Thanks to Martin Audet for
  bringing this to our attention.
- Improved latency of TCP BTL.
- Fixed index value in MPI_TESTANY to be MPI_UNDEFINED if some
  requests were not MPI_REQUEST_NULL, but no requests finished.
- Fixed several Fortran MPI API implementations that incorrectly used
  integers instead of logicals or address-sized integers.
- Fix so that Open MPI correctly handles the Fortran value for .TRUE.,
  regardless of what the Fortran compiler's value for .TRUE. is.
- Improved scalability of MX startup.
- Fix datatype offset handling in the coll basic component's
  MPI_SCATTERV implementation.
- Fix EOF handling on stdin.
- Fix missing MPI_F_STATUS_IGNORE and MPI_F_STATUSES_IGNORE
  instanatiations.  Thanks to Anthony Chan for pointing this out.
- Add a missing value for MPI_WIN_NULL in mpif.h.
- Bring over some fixes for the sm btl that somehow didn't make it
  over from the trunk before v1.0.  Thanks to Beth Tibbitts and Bill
  Chung for helping identify this issue.
- Bring over some fixes for the iof that somehow didn't make it over
  from the trunk before v1.0.
- Fix for --with-wrapper-ldflags handling.  Thanks to Dries Kimpe for
  pointing this out to us.
