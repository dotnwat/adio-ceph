[no-available-pls]
No available launching agents were found.

This is an unusual error; it means that Open RTE was unable to find
any mechanism to launch proceses, and therefore is unable to start the
process(es) required by your application.
#
[daemon-died-no-signal]
A daemon (pid %d) died unexpectedly while attempting to launch so we are aborting.

This may be because the daemon was unable to find all the needed shared
libraries on the remote node. You may set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to have the
location of the shared libraries on the remote nodes and this will
automatically be forwarded to the remote nodes.
#
[daemon-died-signal]
A daemon (pid %d) died unexpectedly on signal %d  while attempting to
launch so we are aborting.

This may be because the daemon was unable to find all the needed shared
libraries on the remote node. You may set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to have the
location of the shared libraries on the remote nodes and this will
automatically be forwarded to the remote nodes.
#
[incomplete-exit-cmd]
One or more daemons could not be ordered to exit. This can be caused by a
number of rather rare problems, but typically is caused by a daemon having
died due to the failure of a node or its communications. This could result
in an incomplete cleanup on the affected nodes. Please see below for a list
of nodes which may require additional cleanup.

We are truly sorry for the inconvenience.
#
[incomplete-kill-procs-cmd]
One or more daemons could not be ordered to kill their local processes.
This can be caused by a number of rather rare problems, but typically
is caused by a daemon having died due to the failure of a node or its
communications. This could result in an incomplete cleanup on the affected
nodes. Additional information may be available below.

We are truly sorry for the inconvenience.
