[odls-default:could-not-kill]
WARNING: A process refused to die!

Host: %s
PID:  %d

This process may still be running and/or consuming resources.

[odls-default:could-not-send-kill]
WARNING: A process refused the kill SIGTERM signal!
         This should never happen unless the application is changing the
         parent/child relationship permissions.

Host:  %s
PID:   %d
Errno: %d

This process may still be running and/or consuming resources.

[orte-odls-default:execv-error]
Could not execute the executable "%s": %s

This could mean that your PATH or executable name is wrong, or that you do not
have the necessary permissions.  Please ensure that the executable is able to be
found and executed.

#
[nodeid-out-of-range]
The id of a node is out of the allowed range.

Value given: %ld
Max value allowed: %ld

This may be resolved by increasing the number of available node id's by
re-configuring Open MPI with the --enable-jumbo-clusters option, and then
re-running the application
#
[odls-default:multiple-paffinity-schemes]
Multiple processor affinity schemes were specified (can only specify one):

Slot list: %s
opal_paffinity_alone:  true

Please specify only the one desired method.
#
[odls-default:slot-list-failed]
We were unable to successfully process/set the requested processor
affinity settings:

Specified slot list: %s
Error: %s

This could mean that a non-existent processor was specified, or
that the specification had improper syntax.
#
[odls-default:invalid-node-rank]
An invalid node rank was obtained - this is probably something
that should be reported to the OMPI developers.
#
[odls-default:invalid-local-rank]
An invalid local rank was obtained - this is probably something
that should be reported to the OMPI developers.
#
[odls-default:invalid-phys-cpu]
An invalid physical processor id was returned when attempting to
set processor affinity. This is probably something that should be
reported to the OMPI developers - your system may not support
this functionality.
#
[odls-default:failed-set-paff]
An attempt to set processor affinity has failed - please check to
ensure that your system supports such functionality. If so, then
this is probably something that should be reported to the OMPI developers.
