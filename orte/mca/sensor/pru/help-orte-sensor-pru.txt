[orte-rmaps-resilient:alloc-error]
There are not enough slots available in the system to satisfy the %d slots 
that were requested by the application:
  %s

Either request fewer slots for your application, or make more slots available
for use.
[orte-rmaps-resilient:multi-apps-and-zero-np]
RMAPS found multiple applications to be launched, with
at least one that failed to specify the number of processes to execute.
When specifying multiple applications, you must specify how many processes
of each to launch via the -np argument.

[orte-rmaps-resilient:per-node-and-too-many-procs]
There are not enough nodes in your allocation to satisfy your request to launch
%d processes on a per-node basis - only %d nodes were available.

Either request fewer processes, or obtain a larger allocation.
[orte-rmaps-resilient:n-per-node-and-too-many-procs]
There are not enough nodes in your allocation to satisfy your request to launch
%d processes on a %d per-node basis - only %d nodes with a total of %d slots were available.

Either request fewer processes, or obtain a larger allocation.
[orte-rmaps-resilient:n-per-node-and-not-enough-slots]
There are not enough slots on the nodes in your allocation to satisfy your request to launch on a %d process-per-node basis - only %d slots/node were available.

Either request fewer processes/node, or obtain a larger allocation.

[orte-rmaps-resilient:no-np-and-user-map]
You have specified a rank-to-node/slot mapping, but failed to provide
the number of processes to be executed. For some reason, this information
could not be obtained from the mapping you provided, so we cannot continue
with executing the specified application.
