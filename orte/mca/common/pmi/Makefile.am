# This library is shared among all the consumers of PMI to provide a
# single point for initializing and shutting down PMI.
#
# This is not a component in the traditional sense.  It is a library
# (either rolled into libmpi if the components are rolled into libmpi
# or a stand-alone library).  Users of this "component" must
# explicitly link against libmca_common_pmi.la when building
# stand-alone libraries (it won't hurt to do so in all cases).
#
# Note that building this common component statically and linking
# against other dynamic components is *not* supported!
