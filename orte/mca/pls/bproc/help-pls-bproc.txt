[bproc-vexecmove-launch]
The bproc PLS component was not able to launch %s on node %d and therefore 
cannot continue. Errno was set to %d.
[bproc-vexecmove-fork]
The bproc PLS component was not able to fork and therefore cannot continue. 
Errno was set to %d.
[no-orted]
The bproc PLS component was not able to find the executable "%s" in the 
current directory, your PATH, or in the directory where Open MPI was 
initially installed, and therefore cannot continue.

For reference, we looked for 

  %s

Your current PATH is:

  %s

We also looked for orted in the following directory:

  %s

You may need to set your PATH properly, or set the MCA parameter 
pls_bproc_orted to be the path to "orted".
[daemon-launch-number]
The bproc PLS component was not able to launch all the daemons on the remote 
nodes and therefore cannot continue.

We attempted to launch %d daemons but only %d were actually launched.

For reference, we tried to launch %s
[daemon-launch-bad-pid]
The bproc PLS component was not able to launch all the daemons on the remote 
nodes and therefore cannot continue.

On node %d the daemon pid was %d and errno was set to %d.

For reference, we tried to launch %s
[daemon-died-no-signal]
A daemon (pid %d) launched by the bproc PLS component on node %d died 
unexpectedly so we are aborting.

This may be because the daemon was unable to find all the needed shared
libraries on the remote node. You may set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to have the
location of the shared libraries on the remote nodes and this will
automatically be forwarded to the remote nodes.
[daemon-died-signal]
A daemon (pid %d) launched by the bproc PLS component on node %d died 
unexpectedly on signal %d so we are aborting.

This may be because the daemon was unable to find all the needed shared
libraries on the remote node. You may set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to have the
location of the shared libraries on the remote nodes and this will
automatically be forwarded to the remote nodes.
[proc-launch-number]
The bproc PLS component was not able to launch all the processes on the remote 
nodes and therefore cannot continue.

We attempted to launch %d processes but only %d were actually launched.

For reference, we tried to launch %s
[proc-launch-bad-pid]
The bproc PLS component was not able to launch all the processes on the remote 
nodes and therefore cannot continue.

On node %d the process pid was %d and errno was set to %d.

For reference, we tried to launch %s
