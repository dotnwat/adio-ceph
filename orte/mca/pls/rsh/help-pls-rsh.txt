[no-local-orted]
The rsh PLS component was not able to find the executable "orted" in
your PATH or in the directory where Open MPI was initially installed,
and therefore cannot continue.

For reference, your current PATH is:

  %s

We also looked for orted in the following directory:

  %s
[concurrency-less-than-zero]
The value of the MCA parameter "pls_rsh_num_concurrent" is less than
or equal to zero (%d).  This parameter is used to determine how many
remote agents (typically rsh or ssh) to invoke concurrently while
launching parallel jobs.  

This value has automatically be reset to 1; processing will continue.
[assume-same-shell-probe-not-implemented]
WARNING: The MCA parameter "pls_rsh_assume_same_shell" was set to 0,
indicating that the rsh pls component should probe for the value of
the remote shell.

Probe functionality has not yet been implemented.  If you need this
functionality, please report it back to the Open MPI team.

Setting the pls_rsh_assume_same_shell parameter to "1" and
continuing...
