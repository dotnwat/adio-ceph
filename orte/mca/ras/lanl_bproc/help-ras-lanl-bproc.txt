[nodelist-failed]
While trying to determine what resources are available, Bproc failed to
find a list of available nodes in your NODES environmental variable.
This may indicate that you failed to request an allocation prior to
executing your application, or a problem with Bproc or your cluster.

Please ensure you have requested and received an allocation and try again,
or contact your system administrator for advice.
#
[no-nodes-avail]
While trying to determine what resources are available, Bproc returned
a list of available nodes that didn't contain any upon which you have
execution privileges. This may indicate a problem with Bproc, your cluster,
or your privileges.
